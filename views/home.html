<h2>Ways To Use Agile Methodology</h2>
Agile aims to create shorter development cycles and frequent product releases, unlike traditional waterfall project management. Because of the shorter time frames, teams can react to change in customer’s needs more effectively. That said, Agile Methodology can help users with the following:

<h2>Project planning</h2>
Before teams can start any project, they need to understand the end goal, the value of the customer, and how they’ll accomplish the project.

Users can take advantage of the Agile project management framework to create a project scope. However, they need to keep in mind that Agile Methodology aims to address changes and addition to a project in a simpler manner. So the project scope they develop should seem changeable.

<h2>Product roadmap creation</h2>
A product roadmap here refers to the features that make up the end-product.  A roadmap is an essential element of the planning stage of an Agile project since teams develop individual features during each sprint/iteration.

At this point, a product owner will also design a product backlog. And when the plan sprints later, the team will pull tasks from the backlog.

<h2>Release planning</h2>
In Waterfall project management, the implementation of the date usually comes after the completion of the entire project.  However, Agile project management uses shorter development cycles, which allows features to get released at the end of each cycle.

Before beginning the project, project owners or teams can make a high-quality plan for feature releases after each sprint. They can always revisit and reassess the release of a particular feature.

<h2>Sprint planning</h2>
Before a sprint can begin, business stakeholders have to first hold a sprint planning meeting.  This helps them to determine what each team member should accomplish during that sprint and how they’ll accomplish it.  Sharing the load evenly between team members ensures that during the sprint, the task gets completed.

Stakeholders can also visually document the workflow to identify and get rid of bottlenecks, improve team transparency, and share understanding within the Agile team. You can also use a sprint planning tool to view team progress daily or weekly and keep everything organized.

<h2>Daily stand-ups</h2>
Daily stand-up meetings help teams complete their project during each sprint and assess the implementation of necessary adjustments. These meetings usually last for only 15 minutes. Each team member has time to briefly explain what they’ve accomplished the previous day and what they’ll be doing on that day.

<h2>Sprint review and retrospective</h2>
By the end of each spring cycle, a team should have a functioning feature or piece of software. If that’s the case, project stakeholders will hold a sprint review meeting where the team will show them the final product. Also, in this meeting, both groups will discuss any product issues that might arise.

In a sprint retrospective meeting, the key stakeholders will discuss how efficient the sprint was, what could have been implemented better, and what achievement occurred throughout the sprint.

The entire team needs to be present during the essential meetings, especially if they’re new to Agile project management. This helps project stakeholders to gauge whether the team can tackle certain task during a sprint and to determine the sprint length for feature projects.
